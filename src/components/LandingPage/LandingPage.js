            <p>
              Sweet Patisserie was created for users who find joy and are caught
              in a love affair with pastries. Sweets are life's sweet little
              joys that humanity can indulge in; and much like our love for
              them, there is always love baked within them. Recipes come with
              all sorts of love and secret ingredients, that's what makes them
              so special.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sweet Patisserie was designed to help you store those lovely
              recipes in order to revisit them time and time again. As a new
              user, you may register to create an account, or as a returning
              user, you may log back in, then be able to view your personal
              dashboard with your saved recipes, and are also able to store
              them! To create and store a new recipe, simply click on the "Add
              Recipe" tab, create a title, add an optional description, list
              your ingredients, and enter the directions/steps; it's that
              simple!
            </p>

            <p>
              If you would like to try out the app, you can either register as a
